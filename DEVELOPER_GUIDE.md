## 1. What This Project Does

This project takes a **news headline** (a short piece of text) and predicts which of **four topics** it belongs to:

| Label | Example Headline |
|-------|-----------------|
| World | "UN holds emergency session on Middle East crisis" |
| Sports | "Lakers defeat Celtics 112-108 in overtime thriller" |
| Business | "Federal Reserve raises interest rates by 0.25%" |
| Sci/Tech | "Apple announces new M3 chip for MacBook Pro" |

It does this using a pre-trained AI model called **BERT**, which has been fine-tuned on the **AG News dataset** (a collection of 120,000+ news articles).

## 2. Key Concepts Explained

### What is NLP?
**Natural Language Processing (NLP)** is the field of AI that deals with how computers understand human language. Tasks include classification, translation, summarization, and more.

### What is a Transformer?
A **transformer** is a type of neural network architecture designed to process sequential data like text. Unlike older approaches that read text word-by-word, transformers look at the entire sentence at once and understand relationships between all words simultaneously.

### What is BERT?
**BERT** (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a specific transformer model created by Google. It was pre-trained on massive amounts of text (Wikipedia, books) and learned a general understanding of language. We "fine-tune" it for our specific task.

### What is Fine-Tuning?
Imagine BERT as a student who has read every book in a library but has never taken a quiz on news topics. **Fine-tuning** is like giving that student a short course on news classification so they can answer our specific questions.

### What is a Tokenizer?
Computers don't understand words. They understand numbers. A **tokenizer** breaks text into pieces (tokens) and converts each piece into a number (token ID).

Example:
```
"Hello world!" → ["hello", "world", "!"] → [7592, 2088, 999]
```

### What is a Tensor?
A **tensor** is just a multi-dimensional array. If you know NumPy arrays, you already know tensors. PyTorch uses tensors instead of NumPy arrays because they can run on GPUs.

### What is a Logit?
A **logit** is the raw, unnormalized output of the model before it's converted to a probability. Think of it as a "score" for each category. We apply **softmax** to convert logits into probabilities that sum to 1.

## 5. File-by-File Breakdown

### 5.1 `preprocess.py` — Data Loading and Tokenization

**Purpose:** Download the AG News dataset, convert text into numbers the model can understand, and save the tokenizer.

#### Constants

```python
MODEL_NAME = "bert-base-uncased"
MAX_LENGTH = 128
```

- `MODEL_NAME`: Which version of BERT to use. "uncased" means it converts everything to lowercase.
- `MAX_LENGTH`: Every input to BERT must be the same length. We pad short texts with zeros and cut long texts to 128 tokens.

#### The Main Function: `load_and_tokenize_data()`

**Step 1 — Load the dataset:**
```python
dataset = load_dataset("ag_news")
```
This downloads the AG News dataset from Hugging Face. It contains:
- **train split:** 120,000 articles
- **test split:** 7,600 articles

Each article has two fields:
- `text`: The headline + description
- `label`: An integer 0-3 (World=0, Sports=1, Business=2, Sci/Tech=3)

**Step 2 — Load the tokenizer:**
```python
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(MODEL_NAME)
```
This downloads the BERT tokenizer, which knows how to split text into the exact tokens BERT expects.

**Step 3 — Define tokenization function:**
```python
def tokenize_function(examples):
    return tokenizer(
        examples["text"],
        truncation=True,       # Cut texts longer than MAX_LENGTH
        padding="max_length",  # Pad short texts to MAX_LENGTH
        max_length=MAX_LENGTH,
    )
```
This function takes a batch of texts and returns a dictionary with:
- `input_ids`: The token IDs (numbers)
- `token_type_ids`: Which tokens belong to which sentence (not important for single-sentence input)
- `attention_mask`: Which tokens are real vs. padding (1 = real, 0 = padding)

**Step 4 — Apply tokenization to the entire dataset:**
```python
tokenized_datasets = dataset.map(
    tokenize_function,
    batched=True,          # Process in batches (faster)
    remove_columns=["text"], # Remove original text column
)
```
The `.map()` method applies `tokenize_function` to every example. It's like Python's `map()` but optimized for datasets.

**Step 5 — Rename the label column:**
```python
tokenized_datasets = tokenized_datasets.rename_column("label", "labels")
```
The Hugging Face `Trainer` expects the column to be named `labels` (plural), not `label`.

**Step 6 — Save the tokenizer:**
```python
os.makedirs("saved_models", exist_ok=True)
tokenizer.save_pretrained("saved_models/tokenizer")
```
Saves the tokenizer configuration so we can reload it later without downloading again.

---

### 5.2 `train.py` — Model Fine-Tuning

**Purpose:** Load BERT, configure training settings, and fine-tune it on the AG News dataset.

#### Constants

```python
MODEL_NAME = "bert-base-uncased"
OUTPUT_DIR = "saved_models/bert-agnews"
NUM_LABELS = 4
EPOCHS = 3
BATCH_SIZE = 64
```

- `NUM_LABELS`: AG News has 4 categories.
- `EPOCHS`: One epoch = one full pass through the training data. 3 epochs means the model sees every training example 3 times.
- `BATCH_SIZE`: How many examples the model processes before updating its weights. Set to 64 for optimal T4 GPU utilization.

#### Loading the Model

```python
model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(
    MODEL_NAME,
    num_labels=NUM_LABELS,
)
```
This loads BERT with an added **classification head** on top. The classification head is a small neural network layer that takes BERT's output and produces 4 scores (one per category).

#### Training Arguments

```python
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir=OUTPUT_DIR,                    # Where to save checkpoints
    eval_strategy="epoch",                    # Evaluate after each epoch
    save_strategy="epoch",                    # Save checkpoint after each epoch
    learning_rate=2e-5,                       # How big each weight update is
    per_device_train_batch_size=BATCH_SIZE,   # 64 for T4 GPU
    per_device_eval_batch_size=BATCH_SIZE * 2,# 128 for faster eval
    num_train_epochs=EPOCHS,                  # Number of passes through data
    weight_decay=0.01,                        # Prevents overfitting
    load_best_model_at_end=True,              # Auto-load the best checkpoint
    metric_for_best_model="accuracy",         # Which metric determines "best"
    logging_dir="./logs",                     # Where to save training logs
    logging_steps=100,                        # Log progress every 100 steps
    fp16=True,                                # Mixed precision (2x speedup on GPU)
    dataloader_num_workers=2,                 # Parallel data loading
    dataloader_pin_memory=True,               # Faster CPU-to-GPU transfer
    gradient_accumulation_steps=2,            # Simulates batch size of 128
    optim="adamw_torch",                      # AdamW optimizer
)
```

**Key concepts:**

- **Learning rate (2e-5 = 0.00002):** Controls how much the model changes its weights after each batch. Too high = model diverges. Too low = training is extremely slow. For fine-tuning BERT, 2e-5 to 5e-5 is the standard range.

- **Weight decay (0.01):** A regularization technique that penalizes large weights. It prevents the model from memorizing the training data (overfitting).

- **Evaluation strategy:** After each epoch, the model is tested on the validation/test set to see how well it generalizes.

- **FP16 (Mixed Precision):** Uses 16-bit floating point numbers instead of 32-bit. This cuts memory usage in half and roughly doubles training speed on modern GPUs (T4, V100, A100) with no loss in accuracy.

- **Gradient Accumulation:** Instead of updating weights after every batch of 64, the model accumulates gradients over 2 batches and updates once. This simulates a batch size of 128 (64 × 2), which improves training stability and convergence.

- **Dataloader Workers:** Uses 2 subprocesses to load and preprocess data in parallel, so the GPU never waits for data.

- **Pin Memory:** Locks CPU memory pages so the CPU-to-GPU data transfer uses DMA (direct memory access), which is faster.

#### Metrics Function

```python
def compute_metrics(eval_pred):
    from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, f1_score
    logits, labels = eval_pred
    predictions = logits.argmax(axis=-1)
    acc = accuracy_score(labels, predictions)
    f1 = f1_score(labels, predictions, average="weighted")
    return {"accuracy": acc, "f1": f1}
```

This function tells the `Trainer` how to evaluate the model:

1. `logits` are the raw scores from the model (e.g., `[-2.1, -3.5, 4.8, -1.2]`)
2. `logits.argmax(axis=-1)` picks the index of the highest score (e.g., index 2)
3. `accuracy_score` compares predictions to true labels
4. `f1_score` with `average="weighted"` computes F1 for each class and weights by class size

#### The Trainer

```python
trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=tokenized_datasets["train"],
    eval_dataset=tokenized_datasets["test"],
    compute_metrics=compute_metrics,
)
```
The `Trainer` is a Hugging Face utility that handles the entire training loop: batching, forward pass, loss computation, backpropagation, weight updates, evaluation, logging, and checkpointing.

#### Training and Saving

```python
trainer.train()
trainer.save_model(OUTPUT_DIR)
```
`trainer.train()` runs the training loop. `trainer.save_model()` saves the final model weights and configuration.

#### GPU Detection

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(f"Using device: {'cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu'}")
    if torch.cuda.is_available():
        print(f"GPU Name: {torch.cuda.get_device_name(0)}\n")
```
This prints the detected GPU at startup so you can verify you're using the correct device (e.g., "Tesla T4" on Colab).

---

### 5.3 `evaluate.py` — Model Evaluation

**Purpose:** Load the trained model, run it on the test set, and print detailed metrics.

#### Why a Separate Evaluation Script?

The training script already evaluates during training, but this script:
1. Loads the **final saved model** (not from memory)
2. Runs a **full evaluation** on the entire test set
3. Prints a **detailed classification report** (precision, recall, F1 per class)

#### Key Differences from Training

```python
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
model.to(device)
```
This moves the model to the GPU if available. During training, the `Trainer` handles this automatically.

```python
model.eval()
```
This puts the model in **evaluation mode**. Some layers (like dropout) behave differently during training vs. evaluation.

```python
with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model(**inputs)
```
`torch.no_grad()` disables gradient computation. During evaluation, we don't need gradients, so this saves memory and speeds things up.

#### Batched Inference

```python
for i in range(0, len(test_data), BATCH_SIZE):
    batch_texts = test_data[i:i+BATCH_SIZE]["text"]
    ...
```
The test set has 7,600 examples. Processing them all at once would run out of memory. Instead, we process them in batches of 32.

#### Classification Report

```python
print(classification_report(all_labels, all_preds, target_names=LABELS))
```
This prints a table like:

```
              precision    recall  f1-score   support

       World       0.96      0.97      0.96      1900
      Sports       0.98      0.97      0.98      1900
    Business       0.94      0.93      0.94      1900
    Sci/Tech       0.93      0.94      0.93      1900

    accuracy                           0.95      7600
   macro avg       0.95      0.95      0.95      7600
weighted avg       0.95      0.95      0.95      7600
```

---

### 5.4 `app.py` — Streamlit Web Application

**Purpose:** Provide a user-friendly web interface for live predictions.

#### Caching the Model

```python
@st.cache_resource
def load_model_and_tokenizer():
    tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(TOKENIZER_DIR)
    model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(MODEL_DIR)
    model.eval()
    return tokenizer, model
```
`@st.cache_resource` tells Streamlit to load the model **only once**. Without this, the model would reload every time the user clicks a button, which would be very slow.

#### Prediction Function

```python
def predict(text, tokenizer, model):
    inputs = tokenizer(text, truncation=True, padding="max_length",
                       max_length=MAX_LENGTH, return_tensors="pt")
    
    with torch.no_grad():
        outputs = model(**inputs)
        probs = torch.softmax(outputs.logits, dim=-1)
    
    pred_idx = probs.argmax(dim=-1).item()
    confidence = probs[0][pred_idx].item()
    
    return LABELS[pred_idx], confidence, probs[0].tolist()
```

Step by step:
1. Tokenize the input text into numbers
2. Pass through the model to get raw scores (logits)
3. Apply **softmax** to convert logits to probabilities
4. Find the index of the highest probability
5. Map that index to a label name
6. Return the label, confidence, and all probabilities

#### UI Components

```python
st.title("News Topic Classifier Using BERT")
user_input = st.text_area("Enter news headline:", height=100)
if st.button("Classify", type="primary"):
    ...
    st.success(f"Predicted Topic: **{label}**")
    st.metric("Confidence", f"{confidence:.2%}")
    st.progress(prob, text=f"{lbl}: {prob:.2%}")
```
These are Streamlit UI components that create the web interface.

## 7. How BERT Works (Simplified)

### The Big Picture

BERT reads text and produces a **representation** (a vector of numbers) that captures the meaning of the text. Here's a simplified view:

```
Input: "The bank of the river was muddy"
                │
                ▼
        ┌───────────────┐
        │   Tokenizer   │  "the" "bank" "of" "the" "river" "was" "muddy"
        │               │  → [101, 1996, 2924, 1997, 1996, 3303, 2001, 9038, 102]
        └───────┬───────┘
                │
                ▼
        ┌───────────────┐
        │  Embedding    │  Convert each token ID to a 768-dimensional vector
        │    Layer      │
        └───────┬───────┘
                │
                ▼
        ┌───────────────┐
        │  Transformer  │  12 layers of self-attention + feed-forward networks
        │   Encoder     │  Each layer refines the representation
        │   (×12)       │
        └───────┬───────┘
                │
                ▼
        ┌───────────────┐
        │  [CLS] Token  │  Special token whose output represents the whole sentence
        │   Output      │  → 768-dimensional vector
        └───────┬───────┘
                │
                ▼
        ┌───────────────┐
        │ Classification│  Linear layer: 768 → 4
        │     Head      │  → [score_world, score_sports, score_business, score_scitech]
        └───────────────┘
```

### Self-Attention (The Key Innovation)

Self-attention lets each word "look at" every other word in the sentence and decide how much attention to pay to it.

Example: In "The **bank** of the **river** was muddy", the word "bank" pays attention to "river" and understands it means the side of a river, not a financial institution.

### Why "Bidirectional"?

Older models read text left-to-right or right-to-left. BERT reads the entire sentence at once, so it understands context from both directions simultaneously.

## 8. Training Process Explained

### What Happens During One Training Step

```
1. Take a batch of 64 examples
2. Tokenize them → input_ids, attention_mask
3. Forward pass through BERT → logits (raw scores)
4. Compute loss (cross-entropy between logits and true labels)
5. Backward pass → compute gradients (accumulated, not yet applied)
6. After 2 batches, average the gradients and update weights
7. Repeat with next batch
```

### What "Epochs" Mean

- **1 epoch** = the model has seen every training example once
- With 120,000 examples and batch size 64: 120,000 / 64 = 1,875 steps per epoch
- With gradient accumulation of 2: 1,875 / 2 = 938 weight updates per epoch
- With 3 epochs: 1,875 × 3 = 5,625 total training steps

### Why a Small Learning Rate?

BERT is already smart from pre-training. We only need to **adjust** it slightly for our task. A large learning rate would "unlearn" what BERT already knows. That's why we use 2e-5 (0.00002) instead of typical values like 0.001.

---

## 9. Evaluation Metrics Explained

### Accuracy

```
Accuracy = (Number of correct predictions) / (Total predictions)
```

Simple but can be misleading if classes are imbalanced.

### Precision

```
Precision = (True Positives) / (True Positives + False Positives)
```

Of all the times the model predicted "Sports", how many were actually Sports?

### Recall

```
Recall = (True Positives) / (True Positives + False Negatives)
```

Of all the actual Sports articles, how many did the model correctly identify?

### F1-Score

```
F1 = 2 × (Precision × Recall) / (Precision + Recall)
```

The harmonic mean of precision and recall. A single number that balances both.

### Weighted Average

```
Weighted F1 = (F1_class0 × n_class0 + F1_class1 × n_class1 + ...) / total
```

Each class's F1 is weighted by how many examples it has. This matters when classes are imbalanced.

## 10. Running on Google Colab (Recommended)

If you don't have a powerful machine with a dedicated GPU, you can train this model for free on **Google Colab**. The training script is specifically optimized for the **T4 GPU** that Colab provides.

### Why Google Colab?

| Feature | Your Local Machine (CPU) | Google Colab (T4 GPU) |
|---------|-------------------------|----------------------|
| Training time (3 epochs) | ~2-4 hours | ~10-15 minutes |
| Memory | Limited by your RAM | 16 GB VRAM |
| Mixed precision (FP16) | Not supported | Supported (2x speedup) |
| Cost | Free but slow | Free with Google account |

### Step-by-Step Guide

**Step 1:** Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and create a new notebook.

**Step 2:** Change the runtime to GPU:
- Click **Runtime** → **Change runtime type**
- Select **T4 GPU** from the Hardware accelerator dropdown
- Click **Save**

**Step 3:** Upload your project files or clone your GitHub repo:
```python
# Option A: Upload files manually using the file browser on the left
# Option B: Clone from GitHub
!git clone https://github.com/your-username/News-Topic-Classifier-Using-BERT.git
%cd News-Topic-Classifier-Using-BERT
```

**Step 4:** Install dependencies:
```python
!pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Step 5:** Run training:
```python
!python train.py
```

**Step 6:** After training, download the saved model:
```python
# Download the model as a zip file
!zip -r saved_models.zip saved_models/
from google.colab import files
files.download("saved_models.zip")
```

### Training Script Optimizations for T4 GPU

The `train.py` script includes these T4-specific optimizations:

| Optimization | What It Does | Benefit |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| `fp16=True` | Uses 16-bit floating point math | 2x faster, half the memory |
| `BATCH_SIZE = 64` | Larger batches fit in T4's 16GB VRAM | Fewer steps, faster training |
| `gradient_accumulation_steps=2` | Simulates batch size of 128 | Better convergence |
| `dataloader_num_workers=2` | Parallel data loading | GPU never waits for data |
| `dataloader_pin_memory=True` | Faster CPU-to-GPU transfer | Reduced data transfer time |

## 11. Customization Guide

### Change the Number of Training Epochs

In `train.py`, line 9:
```python
EPOCHS = 3  # Change to 4 or 5 for potentially better results
```

### Change the Batch Size

In `train.py`, line 10:
```python
BATCH_SIZE = 64  # Default for T4 GPU. Reduce to 32 or 16 if you get out-of-memory errors
```

Note: The effective batch size is `BATCH_SIZE × gradient_accumulation_steps`. With the default settings, the effective batch size is 128 (64 × 2).

### Change the Learning Rate

In `train.py`, line 25:
```python
learning_rate=2e-5,  # Try 3e-5 or 5e-5
```

### Use a Different Model

In `preprocess.py` and `train.py`, change:
```python
MODEL_NAME = "bert-base-uncased"
# Other options:
# MODEL_NAME = "bert-large-uncased"   # Bigger, slower, more accurate
# MODEL_NAME = "distilbert-base-uncased"  # Smaller, faster, slightly less accurate
# MODEL_NAME = "roberta-base"         # Different architecture, often better
```

### Add More Categories

If you have a dataset with different labels, change:
```python
NUM_LABELS = 4  # Change to your number of classes
```

And update `LABELS` in `evaluate.py` and `app.py`.

### Change the Maximum Sequence Length

In `preprocess.py`, line 6:
```python
MAX_LENGTH = 128  # Increase for longer texts, decrease for speed
```

Note: BERT's maximum is 512 tokens.

### Use GPU Training

The `Trainer` automatically uses GPU if available. The script prints your device at startup:
```
Using device: cuda
GPU Name: Tesla T4
```

To force CPU (for debugging):
```python
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    ...
    no_cuda=True,  # Force CPU
)
```

## 12. Troubleshooting

### Out of Memory (OOM) Error

**Cause:** Batch size too large for your GPU/CPU memory.

**Fix:** Reduce `BATCH_SIZE` in `train.py`:
```python
BATCH_SIZE = 32  # or even 16
```

If you reduce the batch size, you may want to increase `gradient_accumulation_steps` to maintain the same effective batch size:
```python
gradient_accumulation_steps=4,  # Effective batch size = 16 × 4 = 64
```

### Slow Training

**Cause:** Running on CPU instead of GPU, or batch size too small.

**Fix:** 
- Use a GPU (Google Colab free tier with T4 GPU is recommended)
- Ensure `fp16=True` is set in `TrainingArguments`
- Increase `BATCH_SIZE` if memory allows
- Use `distilbert-base-uncased` instead of `bert-base-uncased`

### "fp16 not supported" Error

**Cause:** Your GPU doesn't support mixed precision (older GPUs).

**Fix:** Set `fp16=False` in `TrainingArguments`:
```python
fp16=False,  # Disable mixed precision
```

### Model Not Learning (Loss Not Decreasing)

**Possible causes:**
- Learning rate too high or too low
- Labels are incorrect
- Dataset is too small

**Fix:** Try `learning_rate=3e-5` or `learning_rate=1e-5`.

### Import Errors

**Fix:** Make sure dependencies are installed:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Streamlit App Not Finding Model

**Cause:** You haven't trained the model yet, or the model is saved in a different location.

**Fix:** Run `python train.py` first, then check that `saved_models/bert-agnews/` exists.
